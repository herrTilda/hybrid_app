# A Physiologically Based Digital Twin for Alcohol Consumption – Predicting Real-life Drinking Responses and Long-term Plasma PEth 

This repository contains the code for the eHealth application prototype developed in the the publication titled \"A physiological-twin for alcohol consumption: connecting short-term drinking habits to plasma PEth\", [available as a preprint on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.18.553836). 

The prototype is hosted at [https://alcohol.streamlit.app](https://alcohol.streamlit.app), but can also be run locally. To do that, install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the application by running `streamlit run Home.py` in the terminal. 

Please note that the application can take a few minutes to start up, primarily when running at [https://alcohol.streamlit.app](https://alcohol.streamlit.app), but also locally. Also note that a valid C-compiler is necessary for running the application locally.
